# Vocab Reader — Nuxt 3

An interactive reading app: the AI generates natural answers while weaving in
target vocabulary words, and a local tracking system (active / dormant / pool)
prioritizes words that still need review.

Fully static — no backend server. The app calls the Anthropic API directly
from the browser using Anthropic's official "bring your own key" CORS header,
so it deploys as a plain static site (GitHub Pages, Netlify, anywhere).

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`. The first screen asks for your **Anthropic API
key** (stored only in `localStorage` on your device, sent directly to
Anthropic per request, never stored on any server).

## Deploy to GitHub Pages (automatic)

1. Push this project to a new GitHub repository.
2. In the repo: **Settings → Pages → Source → GitHub Actions**.
3. Push to `main` (or run the workflow manually from the Actions tab).

`.github/workflows/deploy.yml` is already included — it builds the static
site with `nuxt generate` and publishes it to GitHub Pages automatically on
every push to `main`. Your site will be live at:

```
https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/
```

No extra setup needed — the workflow sets the correct base path
automatically from your repository name.

## Libraries used and why

| Library | Why |
|---|---|
| **Nuxt 3** (`ssr: false`) | Static-site output, works on GitHub Pages with no server |
| **Pinia + @vueuse/nuxt** | Ready-made composables (`useLocalStorage`, etc.) |
| **Dexie** | IndexedDB wrapper — handles far more data than localStorage, and supports sorting/filtering directly (needed for the "top 50 active words" query) |
| **wink-lemmatizer** | Reduces words to their root locally (no API) — unifies leverage/leveraging, etc. |
| **kokoro-js** (Kokoro-82M) | Neural voice running fully in-browser via Transformers.js/WebGPU (WASM fallback) — free, no API, studio-grade quality (graded A/A- on the model's own benchmark for the voices offered). A small curated picker (5 top-graded English voices, American + British) is built in; switching voices does not re-download the base model. First playback downloads the base model once (~86-138MB in q8); native Web Speech API is the instant fallback if that fails |
| **Tailwind CSS** | Fast, clean styling |

## How reading works

- **One tap** on *any* word says it out loud, instantly (clips for pushed words
  are generated in the background and cached). Repeat count is a setting.
- **Two taps** open the meaning card: contextual definition + examples, written
  for your current position in the word list.
- Only the words the system is currently pushing are highlighted. Everything
  else stays plain but remains tappable, so an unexpected word (a technical
  sense like "terminal" in computing) is one tap away.

## How the learning loop works

**One gate for every word.** A word enters the scheduler (FSRS) only after it
has appeared in replies 8 times, at least 24h apart, without a tap. A tap
enters it immediately as "not known", wherever it sits, and resets its count.
- Below the edge: passing the gate enters the scheduler at once, no limit.
- Above the edge: at most 10 such entries per day, most frequent first; the
  rest wait in a queue.

**The edge** is the rank below which 98% of the words currently in review sit.
Until 30 words reach review, the placement test result is used instead.

**Placement test** (first run, measure only): 5 words far apart find your area,
then 20 around it pin it down. Nothing enters the scheduler. The starting edge
is the last known word before the first real unknown one.

**What is sent to the AI, in strict order:**
1. Scheduler reviews that are due (oldest first).
2. Gaps below the edge: words shown before but still collecting views, then
   words never shown.
3. New words above the edge, 10 per day (counted on words that actually
   appeared) — only once steps 1 and 2 have nothing left unshown.

**History:** only the last 2 exchanges are re-sent with each question.

## Inspecting every turn

Under each reply there is a collapsible line showing how many of the offered
words the AI actually used. Opening it lists every word grouped by why it was
sent (due for review, gap below the frontier, new past the frontier, random
probe, or steering), with unused words faded and struck through.

## Dashboard

Four tabs: **Progress** (frontier, counts, band-by-band coverage and mastery,
hardest words, cache sizes), **Words** (the full table: every counter the system keeps
per word — rank, stage, times seen, taps, streak, times offered, times skipped,
next review — with search, filters by stage and by why it was sent, sorting on
any column, CSV export, and a per-word detail view), **AI** (words the AI keeps skipping, on-device model
picker), **Settings** (voice and repeat, evidence rules, frontier rules,
conversation and display, export/import) — every control has a one-line
explanation underneath it.

## Honest notes on this version's scope

- **`data/frequency.json`** (9,000 words) and **`data/dictionary.json`**
  (an English definition for every one of them) are generated, not
  hand-typed: frequency order comes from
  [wordfreq-en-25000](https://github.com/aparrish/wordfreq-en-25000); each
  word is reduced with the app's own lemmatizer, then kept only if
  [WordNet](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/) lists it as a lowercase common
  word, which removes people, places and most brand names. Profanity,
  internet slang and a short manual list of name-like words are also
  removed. Definitions are WordNet's most frequent sense. CEFR levels are an
  approximation from frequency rank, not a linguist-reviewed
  classification. A1/A2 words are never tracked (already known at B1-B2).
- **Local data upgrades itself**: when the vocabulary list changes, the
  browser database is migrated on first load — untracked/below-level words
  are removed and your click/exposure progress on the rest is kept.
- **Voice runs in a Web Worker** so generating speech never freezes the page.
- **Try before you connect a key**: the setup screen offers "Try a demo
  first" — it seeds sample vocabulary data and a sample AI reply so you can
  test clicking words, the neural voice, and multi-passage selection with
  zero API calls, then lets you paste your key right there to switch into
  the real app.
- **Scanning engine** matches by lemma (root form) only — it doesn't
  disambiguate between two meanings of the same spelling (e.g. "bank" as a
  financial institution vs. a riverbank).
- **Cross-device sync**: manual Export/Import (JSON) buttons only. Drop the
  exported file in a synced Google Drive folder to move data between devices
  — there's no automatic upload/download in this version.
- **API key security**: calling Anthropic directly from the browser means the
  key is visible to anyone with access to the browser's dev tools on that
  device. Fine for a personal, bring-your-own-key tool like this; not
  suitable for a public multi-user product without a server-side key.
